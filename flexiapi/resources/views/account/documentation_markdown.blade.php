# Admin panel

This panel is only accessible to admin accounts.

## Generate an API Key

As an administrator, you will be able to generate an API Key allowing you to use the {{ $app_name }} API with the API Key authentication mechanism. Check the related [API Documentation]({{ route('api') }}) to know more about this feature.

## Accounts administration

From the accounts administration panel an administrator will be able to list, create, show, edit and and delete accounts from the attached Flexisip server.

### Display a user account

Each user, identified by a unique number can be managed from the panel. The account can be activated or deactivated (see the Registration section for more information about activation).

You can also set an account as an administrator. The account will then have the same accesses and authorizations as you.

Finally the account page allows you to provision the account, using a QR Code or a unique link that can be shared with the contact.

The provisioning link can be generated and refreshed from this page as well. If the provisiong link is renewed, the old one will be unavailable.

### Create and edit an account

Administrators can create and edit accounts directly from the admin panel. During the edition they can assign contacts (other accounts available in the local database), actions and types the same way it can be done in the [API]({{ route('api') }}).

### Delete an account

The deletion of an account is definitive, all the database related data (password, aliasesâ€¦) will be destroyed after the deletion.

### Create, edit and delete account types

An adminisator can create, edit and delete account types. Those can be used to categorize accounts in clients, they are often used for Internet of Things related devices.
